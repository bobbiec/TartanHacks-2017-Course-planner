The military-civilian dictatorships of the 1970s in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay were a period of State terrorism. This violent period resulted in thousands of disappeared people, political prisoners and exiles. These experiences have had a lasting impact in the new democracies. There is still a debate over how to address violations of human rights and how to make sense of the past, so that these events dont happen again. There has been a rich production of movies focusing on this historical period that serves as a document of how the struggles over how to come to terms with a traumatic past have been dealt with by different countries. These films also provide a glimpse of how popular culture serves as a vehicle to construct a social memory of recent history. Through films new generations that did not experience these traumatic events learns about what happened and what it means for particular social actors. We will analyze films from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in order to better understand how these countries have dealt with a contested past.

Part of the first wave of quality television series by which HBO changed the way people conceived of the artistic possibilities of the medium, the Wire differed from its contemporaries like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in its realism and its smaller audience. Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling long-form TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be binge-watched. The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.

Software is transforming the way companies innovate; how they interact with customers and ecosystem partners, the way they collaborate and communicate, how they access and distribute information, and how they co-ordinate and control. Traditional approaches that assume stability have given way to dynamic recipes.  The new imperative is to swiftly navigate changing realities. Flexibility, versatility and the capacity to quickly adapt to evolving situations have become the critical challenges. The course is based on the new edition of Prof. Evans book Super-Flexibility for Knowledge Enterprises (co-authored with Prof. Bahrami from Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley).

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a sweet spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society?  This course tries to address the above questions. In particular, the course begins by comparing early definitions of privacy to the current information-focused debate. It then focuses on:  - technological aspects of privacy (privacy concerns raised by new IT such as the Internet, wireless communications, and computer matching; tracking techniques and data mining; privacy enhancing technologies and anonymous protocols,), - economic aspects (economic models of the market for privacy, financial risks caused by privacy violations, the value of customer information, - legal aspects (laissez-faire versus regulated approaches, US versus EU legal safeguards,)   - managerial implications (the emerging role of Chief Privacy Officers, compulsory directives and self-regulative efforts, and - policy aspects (trade-offs between individual privacy rights and societal needs,)", "department": "Heinz College Wide Courses", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "DNM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": null, "end": null, "begin": null, "building": "DNM"}], "instructors": ["Marotta, Veronica"], "name": "Z4"}], "name": "Privacy in the Digital Age", "coreqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0}, "24-673": {"desc": "Soft, elastically-deformable machines and electronics will dramatically improve the functionality, versatility, and biological compatibility of future robotic systems.

Using the writings of historians, as well as primary sources such as newspapers, travel accounts, letters, and literature, Global Empire will follow the development of the British Empire from the sixteenth century to its demise after the Second World War.  We will pay particular attention to the way Britains economic interests shaped its imperial project. Thus, the course will explore topics such as colonial commodities, slavery, imperialism, naval power, free trade, and war in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and the British Isles. Ultimately, students will not only be able to recognize and assess the role of the British Empire in the development of globalization, but will also be able to identify the ways that economic interests shape state policy in the world we live in today.", "department": "History", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "235A", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [1, 3, 5], "end": "01:20PM", "begin": "12:30PM", "building": "BH"}], "instructors": ["Roszman, Jay"], "name": "A"}], "name": "Global Empire: Commerce, Finance, Naval Power in Rise & Fall of British Empire", "coreqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 9.0}, "54-846": {"desc": "In this mini students explore a variety of three-dimensional media techniques as they learn to build models for the Scenic Designer.

We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing. In addition, we explore journalisms glorious past and its role in the promotion and maintenance of democracy. The last segment of the course examines the evolution of journalism in the digital age and the impact that is having on the media landscape, particularly print.

These include degrees of vertical integration, ranging from fully integrated (complete ownership of all the stages of value added), to virtually integrated (where the various stages of the company are linked electronically without ownership). We also look at advantages to be had through horizontal integration (core competencies), where components of value from different products are shared to yield sideways economies of scale. We then look at traditional big business strategy, where economies of scale dominate along with continuous, controlled innovation; a process referred to as scale orchestration. These standard cycle examples include Toyota, Federal Express, McDonalds, Toyota, Starbucks, and Las Vegas Casinos. We next look at Schumpeterian markets, where rapid wealth creation is followed by the gale of creative destruction, which yields advantage that must be renewed rapidly.

Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders.

There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling long-form TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be binge-watched. The Wire was rooted in producer/writers David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.

application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn how to build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud.   The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations. Students will be evaluated based on 5 mini-projects/assignments, class participation, weekly reading summaries, and a final project.

Both types of decisions however, have something in common: they are made in the presence of change and in the absence of explicit information of probabilities, possible alternatives, and outcomes. Our decisions in such situations are the result from the interaction between the dynamic environmental demands and our cognitive processes.

Students will be introduced to different aspects of decision processes by analyzing the sources of error in complex problems, such as cases of accidents and disasters (natural or man-made), in multiple disciplines (e.g., aviation, management, military strategy, and others).  The course will also use simulation-based representations of dynamic decision making situations (e.g., microworlds) to illustrate relevant cognitive processes needed for learning, adaptation and choice. Finally, students will learn how to construct mathematical/computational models of dynamic systems, be able to interpret simulation results and to explore scenarios regarding effects of variables in the models and the predictions that the models can make.", "department": "Social & Decision Sciences", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "1209", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [1, 3], "end": "04:20PM", "begin": "03:00PM", "building": "DH"}], "instructors": ["Gonzalez, Cleotilde"], "name": "A"}], "name": "Dynamic Decisions", "coreqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["36-201"], ["85-211"]], "invert": false}, "sections": [], "prereqs": "36-201 and 85-211", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 9.0}, "94-867": {"desc": "This course introduces modeling frameworks and computational tools to address complex, ill-defined, large-scale decision-making problems that arise in policy and business.

From early times, civilizations with the most advanced materials have dominated the history of warfare and have been responsible for the infrastructural developments that have cradled out societies. As a result, materials have been influential in the trade and commerce between societies and are still to this day, strongly involved in the political, economic and social conflicts worldwide.    Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90 of the countrys energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption.

Topics covered will include conditional processing, arrays and loops, combining files, macro programming, and best programming practices. We will use SAS procedures to explore data and identify important characteristics and possible errors in the data. By the end of the class students should be able to pick up an existing SAS program and understand what it is doing or create an original SAS program.  Students will learn by doing, and all sessions will be taught in the computer lab with hands on programming.", "department": "Heinz College Wide Courses", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "2009", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [2, 4], "end": "02:50PM", "begin": "01:30PM", "building": "HBH"}], "instructors": ["Slaughter, Mary"], "name": "A4"}, {"times": [{"room": "2009", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [2, 4], "end": "11:50AM", "begin": "10:30AM", "building": "HBH"}], "instructors": ["Slaughter, Mary"], "name": "B4"}], "name": "SAS for Public Policy", "coreqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["90-711"]], "invert": false}, "sections": [], "prereqs": "90-711", "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0}, "54-104": {"desc": "(Speech and Phonetics) The second semester is a continued investigation and drill of the thirty-nine sounds of the Standard American English Dialect as well as the music of the dialect.

It combines analytic with experimental methods to investigate strategic interactions in bidding, buying, selling, designing trading mechanisms, consumption based portfolio analysis, investment dynamics, and governance. We begin with an explanation of trading in electronic limit order markets, an exchange mechanism that has been widely adopted in the financial sector, is paradigmatic of most markets, and holds great promise for efficiently regulating procurement practices and inventory control in micromarkets. To analyze optimal trading rules, we investigate the role of arbitrage in limit order markets, and then probe more deeply into auctions, which are essentially one sided limit order markets. We describe the main kinds of auctions, investigate optimal bidding behavior, and compare revenue outcomes from different auction formats. Individual valuations form the basis for bidding and trading, and in the third section of the course we investigate how those valuations are determined. We analyze how investment profiles are valued from their underlying dynamic choice profiles, we characterize attitudes towards risk, and we explain preferences for consumption at different points in time. Armed with estimates of risk tolerance and timing preferences for consumption over the life cycle, we derive optimal consumption smoothing, which determines investment and portfolio choices, and motivates the demand for mutual and pension funds, hedging practices, and more generally a financial retail sector. This leads us to our last topic, problems peculiar to large investors, whose decisions affect the affect of the operations of the firm.

Building and maintaining a brand is a philosophical and tactical undertaking. In this course, students will build a foundational understanding of branding through class discussions, articles and case studies. Students will examine the difference between brand and marketing/communications as well as the importance of brand as business and its application to global branding. They will also examine how a company finds and communicates value proposition relative to their competitors, users and communities at large. Students will consider the impacts of brand valuation as well as the spectrum of branded content.

In 2011, Luis Suarez a Uruguayan soccer player was punished for allegedly calling French footballer Patrice Evra negro in England. But was the word negro, said in Spanish, racist?   Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it.

We will be concerned with questions such as these: What are the goals and purposes of courses in writing? On what assumptions about learning and the nature of writing are they based? How are they influenced by history and by institutional and material conditions? How do they get translated into methods for teaching writing? And what methods work best for which purposes? What do we know about the effect and effectiveness of such methods? What are the central issues in writing instruction at the college level today? Well examine these questions from a range of perspectives and also gain experience analyzing and constructing the major components of any course: grounding principles, course design, methods, and evaluation.  Students may choose different options for the final project, depending upon students interests and prior knowledge.

Illustrative examples will be drawn from the area of semiconductor nanostructures, including their applications in novel and next-generation electronic, photonic, and sensing devices.  The course begins with a review of basic concepts in quantum physics (wave-particle duality, Schrdingers equation, particle-in-a-box, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then continues with a discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and  bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures.

In this course, we will explore the Spanish body through the lens of medical humanities and disability studies. The former includes texts created in medical environments and from medical experiences, written by doctors, patients and members of the community. Spain has a rich history of doctor/authors that can provide some level of insight into the narrative of the Spanish medical community. Disability studies, on the other hand, views the body in a non-medical context. Instead of proposing the abnormal body as a medical phenomenon to be studied in a petri dish, these expression of (corpo)reality trace ideas of normalcy as societal constructs. The theme of disability in Spain comes in to play with the wealth of organizations dedicated to disability rights (while also mired in controversy).   The texts will come in the form of advocacy pamphlets, novels written by doctors, fictional (and non) depictions of the medical field, illness, etc., painting and sculpture, and films. This course will prompt us to pay attention to the objectification and abjectification of these bodies and consider that through this awareness must also come understanding the body as a text - not an object - but a text that warrants intricate observation.

You will learn to analyze pricing strategies including versioning and bundling; product standardization decisions; managing product complements; exploiting network effects; managing platform competition. This course will help you understand the unique economic characteristics seen in todays technology-intensive markets and how they impact the strategic interactions among firms and consumers. We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies.

This course is not a survey but rather a workshop; we dont talk about writing but rather we write. Assignments are frequent and pointed. Writing exercises are assigned to stretch the students writing muscles as they work towards completing their final script. Entrance in the course is by permission of the instructor only.

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.  This course explores how firms can make better SCM decisions, focusing mostly on tactical challenges, but also touching on some strategic and operational topics.

One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems.

We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches.

An analogous discussion for photons is also presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of the low-dimensional nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, photonics, biology, chemistry, and bio-engineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility of nanostructures.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.

This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

After throwing off the violent exploitation of its colonial conquerors, the Haitians then found themselves shunned and quarantined by its neighbors, including the United States.

The main goal of the course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how financial reports provide unusually specific and detailed (but not perfect) information about certain risks and performance of these financial institutions. Their financial statements increasingly are based on fair value accounting and their financial reports include increasingly extensive risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures. Both fair value accounting and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures are necessary ingredients for financial reports to convey financial institutions risk and performance in todays world of complex, structured, value and risk partitioning financial instruments and transactions. While financial institutions often report imperfect (or worse) fair value measurements and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures, careful joint analysis of the information they do provide invariably yields important clues about their risks and performance.   While this course is most relevant to students interested in financial institutions, much of the accounting material also pertains to a varying extent to other types of firms.

A leading idea is functorial semantics, according to which a model of a logical theory is a set-valued functor on a category determined by the theory.

Such categorical models occur, for example, in denotational semantics. e.g. treating the ambda-calculus via the theory of cartesian closed categories. Higher-order logic is treated categorically by the theory of topoi. In particular we will cover the notion of realizability topos, which is a category theoretic incarnation of the realizability technique from proof theory.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity.

Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

Much of the course will be taught in a graduate seminar style in which all students will be expected to do a weekly reading assignment and each week different students will prepare a presentation for the class. Students will also work on a group project throughout the semester. The course is open to all graduate students who have technical backgrounds. The 12-unit course numbers (08-734 and 5-836) are for PhD students and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will be expected to play a leadership role in a group project that produces a paper suitable for publication.  The 9-unit 500-level course numbers (08-534 and 05-436) are for juniors, seniors, and masters students.

From Waterfall to Iterative and Incremental, to Agile and Lean, we have witnessed waves of new methods, each adding significant value to the field. However, the plethora of available methods poses a challenge for software practitioners: Which method should be adopted on a specific software project?  Software Engineering Methods addresses this challenge by introducing students to emerging approaches for developing software-intensive systems. Given the vast spectrum of software development endeavors, these approaches aim at defining custom hybrid methods by focusing on software development principles and practices together with their applicability to specific project contexts. Students learn to analyze the context of a software project and recommend a custom hybrid development method that satisfies the projects specific needs.  Students apply this knowledge in the context of a semester-long project. Their goal is to recommend the optimal software development method for a given project aimed at developing a specific software system. They model their recommended method and define a multi-level software engineering plan to enact the method. They build the first system increment by adopting their own method and following their own plan. They monitor their progress and reflect on the effectiveness of their approach and the need for continuous process improvement.

Sentences have different moods, and these moods correspond to their function with respect to the encoding and transmission of information. Indicative sentences carry information, interrogative sentences request information, imperative sentences demand action, conditional and modal sentences present alternative possibilities, and so on. The goal of this course is to investigate the structure of the linguistic entities by which these communicative functions are realized.

Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.

Bank lending, interest on bank loans, the M2 money stock, and the interbank interest rate are explored in terms of the model.  A stylized history of financial intermediation explains the coexistence of banking, bond finance, and equity finance. The fundamental fragility of money and banking is explained via its evolution and the origins of the financial crisis of 2007-09. We see why higher minimum equity capital requirements for banks are the best regulatory means of maintaining a healthy and stable financial system.  We identify the intended and unintended consequences for banking stability of central bank last resort lending. Actual Federal Reserve monetary and credit policies in the financial crisis are evaluated using the model. Finally, the model is employed to show how quantitative easing (QE) at the zero interest bound works in the banking system, and to see why the payment of interest on bank reserve balances at the central bank will play a central role in the exit from the zero interest bound.", "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "152", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [1, 3], "end": "05:15PM", "begin": "03:30PM", "building": "POS"}], "instructors": ["Goodfriend, Marvin"], "name": "A3"}, {"times": [{"room": "153", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [2], "end": "10:00PM", "begin": "06:30PM", "building": "POS"}], "instructors": ["Goodfriend, Marvin"], "name": "E3"}], "name": "Money, Banking and Finacial Markets", "coreqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "units": 6.0}, "57-926": {"desc": "Provides an opportunity for students to play in small ensembles, advised by faculty coaches.

Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

As part of our exploration of advanced nonfiction styles, we examine the six major genres of journalistic nonfiction: the trend story, the profile, the explanatory, the narrative, the point-of-view and the investigative. We will read, critique, discuss and analyze examples of each genre, and students will produce work of their own in four of the genres. Students may substitute (for one of the four writing genres) independent research on a topic of their choosing.

Students are encouraged to bring their own experiences, questions, and ideas into the course.

It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring use or modification of Matlab scripts. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models.

The main focus of this course is on genre films. Popular genres have often been dismissed to be formulaic and commercially oriented, which has hampered our perceptions around the complex ways in which genre cinema has engaged with historical changes. Breaking away from the conventional view, this course reads genre films as an important venue to inquire into sociocultural formations. More specifically, this course takes genre cinema to be a contact zone where a variety of narrative and formal orientations intersect, compete, and negotiate with one another: nationalism and transnationalism, convention and innovation, the traditional and the modern, official memory and counter history, realism and imagination, and so on.

We begin by presenting (predicate) logic and strategic ways of constructing proofs; that is extended to a systematic development of elementary set theory and the formal representability of (informal) mathematics in set theory.  With this basis, it is possible to show that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, a concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines. The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science. The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic; they provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.

Today, we commonly encounter portraits of smart people as experts, geniuses, or nerds, variously cast as techno-visionaries or hyper-specialized experts, and often struggling with social difficulties. What do these contemporary portraits tell us about the central if unusual role that intellectuals play in our culture? And how have significant transformations in key social institutions like higher education and the mass media shaped our conceptions of, and attitudes towards, intellectuals and intellectual life?  To explore these questions, well look at the history of intellectuals in literature and culture over roughly the last century, touching on a series of key moments and milieux from early portrayals of bohemia in novels like The Sun Also Rises (1926) to the autobiographical writings of controversial political figures like George Orwell and Ernesto Che Guevara, and popular genres like the campus novel and college films.  Along the way, well also read a number of critical and scholarly writings on the subject such as Edward Saids Representations of the Intellectual (1994), as well as essays from critics like Karl Mannheim, Antonio Gramsci, Simone de Beauvoir, Grant Farred and C. Wright Mills.", "department": "English", "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "A19C", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "days": [2, 4], "end": "01:20PM", "begin": "12:00PM", "building": "PH"}], "instructors": ["Gotzler, Steven"], "name": "A"}], "name": "Nerds, Experts and Geniuses: Intellectuals in Popular Culture", "coreqs": "76-101", "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": [["76-101"]], "invert": false}, "units": 9.0}, "62-661": {"desc": "Working in cross-disciplinary teams, students will explore light as art, interactive design and programming using a Pharos lighting control system.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.  This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

What does scientifically based education research mean?  - Does it mean the sort of CMU-ish studies that cognitive and developmental psychologists do when they are interested in how students think about math or science or reading?  - Does it mean massive national randomized field trials on the effect of class size or teacher training or one curriculum versus another?  - Can it include non-experimental, qualitative, case studies and field demonstrations?  - Must it include new technologies that go beyond traditional teacher-student interactions?  2. What constitutes a treatment or an independent variable: lesson content, instructional method, teacher qualifications, student attributes,      educational ?philosophy?  ?approach? 3. What is the appropriate grain size of the measurements and analyses: individual students, classrooms, teachers, schools, school districts, states, nations?  4.

Before it was over, the Great European Witch-Hunt of the early modern era cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its American colonies. Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period and why - seemingly just as suddenly - Europeans ultimately came to repudiate them.  This course examines the phenomenon of the early modern witch-hunts in both their European and colonial contexts, focusing on the origin and rationale of early modern witch beliefs and the factors driving the timing and intensity of witch-hunts, the patterns of accusations, and the ultimate end of the prosecutions.  Throughout, we will examine the many regional variations in witch beliefs and prosecutions that make the early modern witch-hunts such a complex historical puzzle.

This class will focus on non-market strategies at the intersection of new technologies, public policies, and business. Entrepreneurs and innovators interested in commercializing technology in the biomedical, energy, transportation, information technology, robotics, aerospace, food, healthcare, and other industries require more than knowing whether a technology works and the potential market.

In this introduction to the interdisciplinary study of literacy?its history, theory, and problems?we will first explore competing theories of what literacy allows you to do, how people learn to carry off different literate practices, and what schools should teach.

We mentor them through Decision Makers (a CMU computer-supported learning project that uses writing as a tool for reflective decision making.)

This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the importance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal discourse, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. In this course we examine the often fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses constitute identities in global contexts, particularly the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War politics influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we study the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed rulers have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law in order to garner international support.

We will study, for example: Why firms in the IT industry give away their best products for free. Why makers of video gaming consoles subsidize end users (but tax game developers) while computer operating system makers subsidize software developers (but overcharge end users). Why Sony won the Blu-Ray format war against HD-DVD which was sponsored by a whole array of companies. In order to understand how firms strategically interact with consumers in technology-intensive industries this course will use a combination of simple but rigorous analytical models, emerging theories, and formal case studies.

How did romantic love come to be considered the epitome of self-fulfillment and what are the problems with that idea?  How has the idea of romantic love been mobilized on behalf of things like the state, the nation, capitalism or revolution?   How do types of love function as a measure of belonging or deviance?  How does the discourse of love enter different kinds of institutional arrangements, such as marriage or state citizenship?  As a way to explore these questions, this course looks to literature but also philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology and law.  Students will immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary range of material as they read, discuss and write about these representations.

A candidate must take the qualifying examination at the time specified by the department, generally within the first three semesters of study. Upon satisfactorily passing the examination, the student will be accepted as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

Yet considerations about how we write - coherence, emphasis, concision, shape, diction, and elegance - can never be fully separated from an understanding of what, why, and for whom we are writing. Ideally, then, far from being an exercise in expressing personal idiosyncrasies, revising style means understanding a set of strategic choices and always weighing these choices in relation to questions such as, Who is my audience? and What is my purpose? This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising your own writing and the writing of others.  Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style?

Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.  Learning Objectives  Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:   Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.   Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.

The intent is to provide the absolutely strongest beginning for all the work to come, to provide a solid foundation for students and instructors to build upon.    Production professionals routinely perform organizational tasks.  In order to be able to meet that challenge, students will need to build a toolkit of information and procedures.  That toolkit will be comprised of knowledge of the kinds of parameters and techniques that are normally selected, the indices that parameters and techniques are evaluated against, and many of the wide range of issues that might point a manager toward one decision or another.    There also exists an entire pantheon of information that people typically learn on the job.  Activities and information presented in this course are designed to try to expose students to as much of this on the job type development as possible with the goal of leapfrogging them past the bottom rung of the workplace ladder.

The course is designed to teach students how to make predictions for a wide variety of events and numbers.  To help develop their prediction skills, the course will provide 1) a structure and methodologies for making predictions and 2) the psychology of forecasting, and 3) incorporate them into a probabilistic framework.  Techniques we advocate are updating frequently, using baselines, learning from your mistakes, providing probabilistic not deterministic predictions, avoiding the use of ideological beliefs as the basis for predictions, and combining multiple and potentially disparate sources of information.

The term Islam suggests centuries of history that embody a creed and a civilization with unity and diversity in its rituals and politics.

Examples include the Shia-Sunni schism or split that has divided Islamdom since the first decades after the death of the Prophet founder in 632; the tensions between unity and sectarianism that relentlessly explode in Muslim countries; the persisting questions of equality and inequality that pertain to gender and race. The works of such historians as Muhammad ibn Ishaq of Medina (704-769), who authored an early biography (Sirat Rasul Allah, Life of the Messenger of Allah), Muhammad ibn Saad of Basra (764-845), who was inspired by Ibn Ishaq, the historian Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (839-923), who authored the multi-volume Tarikh al-rasul wa al muluk (History of the Prophets and Kings),and the 14th-century eminent thinker, Abu Zayd Muhammad Ibn Khaldun, who wrote the Muqaddimah, an Introduction to History, and numerous contemporary scholars help to elucidate part of the problems.

This will involve learning how to read transcripts and transcribe data at different levels of detail, learning how to ask questions about the data based on different analytic interests, and developing a vocabulary of scholarly terms and concepts that will allow you to comment on discourse features as you formulate interesting and persuasive claims. The first part of the course will involve assignments with shared data to develop fundamental skills. In addition, seminar participants will be responsible for selecting pieces of discourse for mini data sessions throughout the semester.

In the first part we will focus on general models of growth and development. This will include a look at growth theory, structural models of development and more recent innovations in thinking about growth. In the second part of the course we will concentrate on specific, mostly domestic problems of economic development. These challenges include poverty and income inequality, agricultural and rural development, the role of human capital, credit and finance, and health and nutrition. The final section of the course will deal with the challenges faced by developing countries in an increasingly global context. This will include issues of trade, macroeconomics and international finance. The course will mix theory with empirical analysis. In addition to traditional economic analysis of development problems, we will also spend time examining insights from two more recent perspectives - institutional economics and the methodological approaches of randomized controlled trials (so-called field experiments).

The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood.  Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

The second is to maximize the utilization of available data, so that no important clue is ever missed. This course aims at building expertize required to achieve those goals in practice. Students will have the opportunity to gain and solidify knowledge of the most important contemporary methods of Data Science, and to develop understanding of practical applicability of the studied topics in business scenarios.
